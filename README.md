# BluePillSoundTones
Simple sound and tone shapes generator based on ChrisMicro's BluePillSound project here:
 https://github.com/ChrisMicro/BluePillSound
 especially on this sketch:
 https://github.com/ChrisMicro/BluePillSound/tree/master/_082_dmaSigmaDeltaTimerOscillator

Can generate:
- tones with length, volume and shape (like piano). 
- basic tones - beeps
- sweep tones

Connect PB0 to amlifier via RC circuit (4,7 kOhm in series then 47nF in paralel).
